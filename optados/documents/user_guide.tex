\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}
\section{Background}
\optados\ is a code for calculating optical, core-level excitation spectra along with full, partial and joint electronic density of states (DOS).  The code was developed by merging the \lindos\ code of Andrew Morris and Chris Pickard at University College London with the optical properties code of Rebecca Nicholls and Jonathan Yates at Oxford University.  \optados\ is written in Fortran 95 and may be run in parallel using {\tt MPI}.  At present \optados\ interfaces with \castep\ and \onetep\ output files, although it is extendible to perform calculations on any set of band eigenvalues and their derivatives generated by any electronic structure code.

The code is freely available through the GPL licence with the request that the following citation (quoted in full) is required in any publication resulting from the use of \optados.

\section{Features}
\optados\ generates optical, core-level excitation spectra along with full, partial and joint electronic DOS. The DOS, PDOS and JDOS take advantage of the linear and adaptive broadening schemes which are more accurate than standard Gaussian broadening since they exploit knowledge of the gradients of the bands at each $k$-point in the Brillouin zone.  These DOS are the basis of the more advanced functionality of \optados, the core and optical spectra.

Along with data text files \optados\ also generates \verb#.agr# files of results to be read by \verb#grace#.

\chapter{Theoretical Background} \label{sec:theory}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Integrals over the Brillouin Zone}

Many energy-resolved spectral properties of a material take the form of an integration of some function, $F_{nm}(\kbf)$ in  reciprocal space over the BZ; where $F_{nm}(\kbf)$ are the elements of a periodic operator which commutes with the crystal translational symmetry.
%
Perhaps the two simplest examples of integrals, hereinafter referred to as type (a) and type (b), take the form at T$=0\,$K of,
\begin{equation}
I^{(a)} \left ( E \right) = \sum_n \int_{\rm BZ} \frac {\d\kbf}{(2\pi)^3} F_{nn}(\kbf) \delta (E_{n\kbf}-E),
\end{equation}
and,
\begin{equation}
I^{(b)} \left ( E \right) = \sum^{\rm occ}_n \sum^{\rm unocc}_m
\int_{\rm BZ} \frac {\d\kbf}{(2\pi)^3} F_{nm}(\kbf) \delta ( E - (E_{m\kbf}-E_{n\kbf})),
\label{Eqn:IntB}
\end{equation}
where $E_{n\kbf}$ are the energy eigenvalues of the system. 
%
They are also extendible to integration over spin-polarised channels
in a straightforward way.

\section{Brillouin Zone Sampling Schemes}

Since the crystal momentum, $\kbf$, is a continuous quantum number the band structure in an \emph{ab initio} calculation is approximated using specific $k$-points within the first Brillouin zone.
%
These $k$-points may be chosen through symmetry perhaps using a Monkhorst-Pack grid \cite{monkhorst:PRB:1976} or  the multi-$k$-point generalisation to the Baldereschi scheme\cite{rajagopal:PRL:1994,morris:PRB:2008}.


Obtaining the energy bands from a set of eigenenergies at discrete $k$-points is non-trivial. 
%
This simplest way of assigning bands, by counting eigenvalues at $k$-points, implicitly assumes that there are no band crossings in the BZ.
%
This is further complicated by ``band kissing'' where bands approach, but due to small interactions between the bands breaking the degeneracy they remain continuous\cite{blochl:PRB:1994,pickard:PRB:1999}.
%
Considering band coefficients and the overlap matrix it has been shown how to assign bands to individual eigenenergies\cite{yazyev:PRB:2002,refson:o2b}, however these still require a broadening scheme to obtain a DOS.
%
Below we detail some approaches to obtaining a DOS from a set of eigenenergies.



\subsection{Gaussian broadening}
%
The reciprocal space is discretised into \emph{sub-cells} each containing a $k$-point which contributes to the integral corresponding to the energy of the $k$-point at their centre.
%
Band dispersion may be crudely approximated by smearing each sub-cell's contribution by a fixed-width Gaussian function, of some width, $\omega$,
\begin{equation}
\delta (E_{n\kbf}-E) \rightarrow \frac{1}{\omega\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp \left (-\frac{1}{2}((E_{n\kbf}-E)/\omega)^2 \right ).  
\end{equation}
This approach requires a large number of $k$-points to converge the DOS since when choosing $\omega$ there is a trade-off between representing the sharp features, such as van Hove singularities\cite{vanHove:PR:1953}  and not introducing spurious oscillations due to the limited $k$-point sampling.
%
The band crossing problem is not present since the bands are modelled as dispersionless.

Fixed-width Gaussian broadening may be chosen  for \optados\ calculations with, \texttt{broadening : fixed}.


\subsection{Interpolative schemes}
In the linear tetrahedron interpolative scheme the BZ is divided into
roughly equal size tetrahedra with the band energy calculated at each
vertex \cite{lehmann:PSS:1972}.
%
The DOS contribution of each tetrahedron is then calculated analytically by linear interpolation.

Linear interpolation suffers from the band crossing problem, since the interpolation always joins the lowest energy bands together, which has the effect of avoiding all band crossing and kissing.
%
The method also does not describe van Hove singularities well since the interpolation is linear. 

Higher-order interpolation schemes, such as the quadratic tetrahedron scheme,  have been proposed which converge the singularities more rapidly than the linear scheme  \cite{boon:JPC:1986,methfessel:JPC:1983,methfessel:JPC:1987}, but these still require a high-density $k$-point grid to mitigate the band-crossing problem.


\subsection{Extrapolative schemes}
Extrapolating from each $k$-point rather than interpolating between adjacent points eliminates the band-crossing problem.
%
M\"uller and Wilkins show that for free electron bands the DOS is a smooth parabola when using the extrapolative method and a rough unconverged spectrum with the interpolative approach when using the same $k$-point mesh \cite{muller:PRB:1984}.

The linear extrapolative scheme still does not represent van Hove singularities as well as a second-order approach.  
%
Band curvatures may be combined with L\"owdin perturbation theory to extrapolate to higher order \cite{pickard:PRB:1999,pickard:PRB:2000}.

Linear extrapolative broadening may be chosen  for \optados\ calculations with, \texttt{broadening : linear}.


\subsection{Adaptive broadening schemes}
An approximation to linear extrapolation method was proposed by Yates \emph{et al.} \cite{yates:PRB:2007}.
%
Each sub-cell's contribution to the DOS is broadened by a Gaussian function whose width, $\omega$, is proportional to the energy band gradient as its $k$-point.
%
This simple approach removes the spurious oscillations of the fixed broadening whilst maintaining the sharper features.
%
The adaptive broadening scheme was introduced in Ref \cite{yates:PRB:2007} in the context of Wannier interpolation of BZ quantities. 
%
However, the scheme is more general that this, and with \optados\ we apply adaptive broadening directly to the quantities obtained from the electronic structure calculation.

Adaptive broadening may be chosen  for \optados\ calculations with, \texttt{broadening : adaptive}.

\section{Density of Electronic States} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

When $F_{nm}(\kbf)=1$ the type (a) integral represents the electronic density of states (DOS) at $E$ and the total ground-state energy, $E_{\rm gs}$ is obtained by integrating over the occupied energies,
\begin{equation}
E_{\rm gs} = \int^{E_{F}}_0 I^{(a)}( E; F_{nm}(\kbf)=1) \d E,
\end{equation}
where $E_F$ is the Fermi energy.

The DOS is plotted with \optados\ using the \verb@task : dos@ command.

The partial, or projected DOS (PDOS), $I_{\mu}$ is obtained by projecting the DOS onto local orbitals, $\mu$, at each atomic site\cite{segall:MP:1996}.
%
In this case,
\begin{equation}
F_{\mu n}(\kbf)=\Re \left \{  T_{\mu n}^{\dagger}(\kbf) T_{\nu n}(\kbf) S_{\nu \mu}(\kbf)^{-1} \right \},
\end{equation}
where $ T_{\mu n}(\kbf)= \langle \Psi_n(\kbf)|\phi_{\mu}(\kbf)
\rangle$ are the overlap matrices between LCAO (linear combination of
atomic orbitals) basis, $\phi_{\mu}$ and planewave states, $\Psi_n$, and  $ S_{\mu n}(\kbf)=\langle \phi_n(\kbf)|\phi_{\mu}(\kbf) \rangle$, the overlap matrices of the LCAO basis.

The PDOS is plotted with \optados\ using the \verb@task : pdos@
command. 
%
The projection is defined using the \verb@pdos@ keyword as described
in the user manual.

In the case of the type (b) integral when $F_{nm}(\kbf)=1$, we
obtain the joint-DOS, (JDOS), for frequency, $\omega$.
%
The JDOS is plotted with \optados\ using the \verb@task : jdos@ command.



\section{Dielectric response}

Core-level spectra and optical properties are related to the complex dielectric function $\varepsilon_1+i\varepsilon_2$.  Within the random phase approximation, the imaginary part of the dielectric function is
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_2 \left ( \omega \right ) = \frac{\pi e^2}{\varepsilon_0 \Omega} \frac{1}{q^2} \left | \langle  \psi^c_{\bf k}   |  \e^{-i{\bf q}.{\bf r}} | \psi^v_{\bf k + q} \rangle\right |^2,
\end{equation}
where $e$ is the charge on an electron, $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, $\Omega$ is the volume of the unit cell and {\bf q} is the momentum transfer \cite{dressel}.
Using the dipole approximation, expressing {\bf q} as $q\,\hat{\bf{u}}$ and taking the limit that $q \rightarrow 0$, $\varepsilon_2$ can be written as an integral of type (b), 
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_2 \left ( \omega \right ) = \frac{\pi e^2}{\varepsilon_0 \Omega} I^{(b)}\left ( \hbar \omega \right ), 
\label{Eqn:Epsilon2}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{equation}
F_{nm}(\kbf)= \left | \langle \psi^c_{\bf k}  |  \hat{\bf u}\cdot {\bf r} | \psi^v_{\bf k} \rangle\right |^2.
\label{Eqn:Dipole}
\end{equation}
Most electronic structure codes do not calculate $\langle \psi^c_{\bf k}  |  {\bf r} | \psi^v_{\bf k} \rangle$ directly due to the ambiguity of a position operator in periodic cells. 
%
Rather they calculate $\langle \psi^c_{\bf k}  |  {\bf p} | \psi^v_{\bf k} \rangle$, where ${\bf p}$ is the momentum operator, which is trivial in reciprocal space. 

Since,
\begin{equation}
{\bf p} = m\dot{r} =\frac{im}{\hbar} [\hat{H},{\bf r}]
\label{Eqn:velocity_op}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator and $m$ the electron mass, it follows that:
\begin{equation}
\langle \psi^c_{\bf k}  |  {\bf r} | \psi^v_{\bf k} \rangle = \frac{\hbar} {im (\e^c-e^v)} \langle \psi^c_{\bf k}  |  {\bf p} | \psi^v_{\bf k} \rangle
\label{Eqn:pvr}
\end{equation}
where $e^c$ and $e^v$ are the energy eigenvalues of the states $|\psi^c_{\bf k} \rangle$ and $|\psi^v_{\bf k} \rangle$.
%
Note that had we added scissor operator term to our Hamiltonian $\hat{H} = \hat{H}_{KS} + \Delta_{\mathrm{scissor}}$ then this also appears in the conversion from momentum matrix elements to optical matrix elements.

Once $\varepsilon_2$ is known, it is possible to use the Kramers-Kronig relations to obtain $\varepsilon_1$ and hence obtain an expression for the full dielectric function.  The dielectric function is a tensor and in \optados\ it is either possible to output the full dielectric tensor or calculate dielectric function for the isotropic average of {\bf q}, a particular direction of {\bf q} or the average of {\bf q} over a plane perpendicular to a given direction.  Once the dielectric function has been calculated, core-level spectra and optical properties can be calculated.  

Core-level and low-loss EELS spectra are all related to the loss function, which is defined as \cite{egerton}:
\begin{equation}
\Lambda = \Im \left ( \frac{-1}{\varepsilon_1 + i\varepsilon_2  } \right ).
\label{Eqn:LossFn}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Core-level spectra}

For core-level spectroscopy (core-loss EELS and x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES)) the incident perturbation is far from resonance and since $\varepsilon_1\approx1$ and $\varepsilon_2\gg1$ equation\,{\ref{Eqn:LossFn} reduces to  $\Lambda = \varepsilon_2$ \cite{egerton}.  
The type (b) integral in equation \ref{Eqn:Epsilon2} becomes a type (a) integral as the energy of the core state is fixed.  Emission spectra (transitions from valence to core XAS) can also be calculated by considering a sum over the occupied rather than unoccupied states.  Core-level spectra are calculated in \optados\ using the \verb@task : core@ command.

Several different experimental geometries are possible for core-level experiments and \optados\ allows the calculation of spectra with {\bf q} in a particular direction or an isotropic average.  
In core-level absorption spectra there are several sources of broadening coming from the experimental set up and lifetime effects.  These can be included in \optados\ by broadening the theoretical spectrum using a combination of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions.  To include instrumentation and lifetime effects, \verb@core_LAI_broadening@ should be set to true.  

\subsection{Optical properties}

In the low-loss EELS regime, the approximations used for core-level spectroscopy do not hold and the full form of the loss function needs to be calculated.  This is done by calculating $\varepsilon_2$ using equations \ref{Eqn:Epsilon2} and \ref{Eqn:Dipole} and then using the Kramers-Kronig relations to find $\varepsilon_1$.  Once the dielectric function has been calculated, the loss-function is simulated (without local field effects) using equation \ref{Eqn:LossFn}. As the dielectric function has been calculated, several other optical properties (which are listed below) can also be computed \cite{dressel}. 

Conductivity, in units of Sm$^{-1}$, is computed using:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_1 = \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_2 \omega, 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\sigma_2 = \varepsilon_0 \left ( 1 - \varepsilon_1 \right ) \omega.
\end{equation}

The refractive index is calculated using:
\begin{equation}
N=n+ik
\end{equation}
where $n$ and $k$ are obtained from,
\begin{eqnarray}
n^2=\frac{1}{2}([\varepsilon_1^2+\varepsilon_2^2]^{\frac{1}{2}}+\varepsilon_1)
& {\rm \;and\;}&
k^2=\frac{1}{2}([\varepsilon_1^2+\varepsilon_2^2]^{\frac{1}{2}}-\varepsilon_1).
\end{eqnarray}


The absorption coefficient, (in units of m$^{-1}$), is computed using
\begin{equation}
\eta = \frac{2k\omega}{c},
\end{equation}
and reflection coefficient, $R$, from,
\begin{equation}
R= \frac{(n-1)^2 + k^2}{(n+1)^2+k^2}.
\end{equation}

All optical properties are calculated in \optados\ using the \verb@task : optics@ command.

\subsection{Intraband term}
For metals it is necessary to consider an intraband contribution to
the optical response, i.e. a term when $n = m$ in equation
\ref{Eqn:IntB}  \cite{dressel,draxl}.  The contribution to
$\varepsilon$ can be written as a type (a) integral with $\hbar\omega$
set to $E_F$, 
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_1^{\rm{intra}} \left ( \omega \right ) = 1 - \frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 \Omega} \frac{1}{(\omega^2+\Gamma^2)} I^{(a)}\left ( E_F \right ),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_2^{\rm{intra}} \left ( \omega \right ) = \frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0 \Omega}\frac{\Gamma}{\omega (\omega^2+\Gamma^2)} I^{(a)}\left ( E_F \right ),
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ denotes the relaxation rate.

\chapter{Parameters}\label{chap:parameters}

\section{{\tt seedname.odi} File}
The \optados\ input file {\tt seedname.odi} has a flexible free-form
structure. 

The ordering of the keywords is not significant. Case is ignored (so
\verb#smearing_width# is the same as \verb#Smearing_Width#). Characters after !, or \#
are treated as comments. Most keywords have a default value that is
used unless the keyword is given in {\tt seedname.odi}. Keywords may be set
in any of the following ways
{\tt
\begin{quote}
smearing\_width = 0.4

smearing\_width : 0.4

smearing\_width   0.4
\end{quote} }
A logical keyword can be set to {\tt .true.} using any of the following
strings: {\tt T}, {\tt true}, {\tt .true.}.

\section{General Parameters}
\subsection[task]{\tt character(len=20) :: task}

Tells the code what to compute. 

The valid options for this parameter are:
\begin{itemize}
\item[{\bf --}]  \verb#dos# (default)
\item[{\bf --}]  \verb#compare_dos#
\item[{\bf --}]  \verb#compare_jdos#
\item[{\bf --}]  \verb#jdos#
\item[{\bf --}]  \verb#pdos#
\item[{\bf --}]  \verb#pdispersion#
\item[{\bf --}]  \verb#optics#
\item[{\bf --}]  \verb#core#
\item[{\bf --}]  \verb#all#
\end{itemize}
Several tasks can be specified \emph{e.g.} to compute dos and jdos use
\verb#task : dos jdos#.  
However, the \verb#compare_dos# and \verb#compare_jdos# tasks can only be combined with each other, and no additional tasks.
\verb#compare_dos# and \verb#compare_jdos# calculate the DOS and JDOS respectively using all broadening schemes. It is good practice to check the quality of the underlying DOS before other tasks are requested. 

\subsection[broadening]{\tt character(len=50) :: broadening}

Specified the scheme used to broaden a discrete sampling of the
Brillouin Zone to a continuous spectral function.

The valid options for this parameter are:
\begin{itemize}
\item[{\bf --}]  \verb#adaptive# (default)

\end{itemize}

\subsection[iprint]{\tt integer :: iprint}

This indicates the level of verbosity of the output from 1,
the bare minimum: 2, with progress reports: to 3, which corresponds to full debugging output.

The default value is 1.

\chapter{CASTEP Examples}

Each example in the \verb#examples/# directory contains example \castep\ input files and a sample \optados\ input file. To keep the \optados\ distribution light \castep\ output files for the examples have not been provided. You need to run \castep\ on the \castep\ input files before running \optados\ on the examples.

\section{Density of States}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Outline} : This is a simple example of using \optados\ for calculating electronic density of states of crystalline silicon in a 2 atom cell.
\item \emph{Input Files}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb#examples/Si2_DOS/Si2_dos.cell# - The \castep\ cell file containing information about the simulation cell.
\item \verb#examples/Si2_DOS/Si2_dos.param# - The \castep\ param file containing information about the parameters for the SCF and spectral calculations.
\item \verb#examples/Si2_DOS/Si2_dos.odi# - The \optados\ input file, containing the parameters necessary to run \optados.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
%%%%  Step 1 %%%%%
\item Perform a \castep\ calculation on the bulk silicon using the  \verb#Si2_dos.cell#  and \verb#Si2_dos.param# input files. 

  \verb#$ castep Si2# 

This should take a couple of seconds to run. More help can be found in  the tutorials  on  the \castep\ website \verb#www.castep.org#.  

%%%%  Step 2 %%%%%
\item Perform an \optados\ calculation.  Add \verb#LEGACY_FILE_FORMAT : true# in the \verb#Si2_DOS.odi# input file, if the \castep\ version you are using is before 6.0. Then execute:   
 
\verb#$ optados.<SYSTEM>.<BUILD>.<COMMS_ARCH>.x86_64 Si2# 

This generates 3 files:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb#Si2.odo# -- \optados\ general output file.
\item \verb#Si2.adaptive.dat# -- The adaptive broadened DOS raw output data.
\item  \verb#Si2.adaptive.agr# -- The adaptive broadened DOS in a file suitable to be plotted by  \verb#xmgrace#.   
\end{itemize}

%%%%  Step 3 %%%%%
\item Open the \verb#Si2.odo# file in a text editor (\emph{e.g.} vi or emacs).  \optados\ has performed a Density of States calculation.

\begin{verbatim}
+------------------------ Fermi Energy Analysis ------------------------------+
| From Adaptive broadening                                                    |
|   Spin Component : 1 occupation between    3.99961 and    4.00003    <- Oc  |
|   Spin Component : 2 occupation between    3.99961 and    4.00003    <- Oc  | 
|         Fermi energy (Adaptive broadening) :   5.4109 eV             <- EfA |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
\end{verbatim}
It has used the integrated DOS to work out the Fermi level, and has suggested the error in the integration by indicating the number of electrons at the Fermi level. Since we had 4 up electrons and 4 down in the input file this analysis seems satisfactory.
\begin{verbatim}
+----------------------- Electronic Data ------------------------------------+
|  Number of Bands                           :            23                 |
|  Grid size                                 :       10 x 10 x 10            |
|  Number of K-points                        :           110                 |
|  Spin-Polarised Calculation                :           True                |
|  Number of up-spin electrons               :             4.00              |
|  Number of down-spin electrons             :             4.00              |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
\end{verbatim}

Since we had \verb#efermi : optados#, \optados\ sets the internal value of the Fermi level to the one it has derived from the DOS. This is important for subsequent calculations. Other valid options are \verb#file#, where \optados\ uses the value calculated by the electronic structure code that generated the eigenvalues;  \verb#insulator#, where \optados\ uses a value calculated from assuming the system is non-metallic; or a value set by the user.

\optados\ now performs some analysis of the DOS at the Fermi level,
\begin{verbatim}
+----------------------- DOS at Fermi Energy Analysis ------------------------+
|                          Fermi energy used :   5.4109 eV                    |
| From Adaptive broadening                                                    |
|   Spin Component : 1   DOS at Fermi Energy :   0.0011 eln/cell       <- DEA |
|   Spin Component : 2   DOS at Fermi Energy :   0.0011 eln/cell       <- DEA |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
\end{verbatim}
From this we may assume that there is a band gap.

Importantly, then \optados\ calculates the band energy from the DOS is has calculated.
\begin{verbatim}
+--------------------------- Band Energy Analysis ----------------------------+
|          Band energy (Adaptive broadening) :       1.3609 eV         <- BEA |
|                  Band energy (From CASTEP) :       1.3622 eV         <- BEC |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
\end{verbatim}
As the quality of the \optados\ calculation is increased these two values should converge to the same answer.

Finally \optados\ shifts the Fermi level to 0\,eV, for the output files.

%%%%  Step 4 %%%%%
\item  The DOS is outputted to {\tt Si2.adaptive.dat}. This contains 5 columns as described in the header of the file:
\begin{verbatim}
########################################################################
#
#                  O p t a D O S   o u t p u t   f i l e

#    4        Up-spin Integrated DOS (electrons)
#    5        Down-spin Integrated DOS (electrons)
#
########################################################################
\end{verbatim}

This file can be plotted by your favourite graph-plotting software. However, \optados\ has made things easy and generated a  {\tt Si2.adaptive.agr} file which is directly plottable using \verb#xmgrace# as shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:Si2_adaptive1}.

\verb#$ xmgrace Si2.adaptive.agr#.

\caption{Density of States of Silicon generated by adaptive broadening and a very coarse energy sampling of 0.1 eV.}
\label{fig:Si2_adaptive1} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

%%%%  Step 5 %%%%%
\item We now try again with a better sampling of the DOS, by setting \verb#DOS_SPACING : 0.001# and also analyse the band gap, by setting \verb#COMPUTE_BAND_GAP : true#.  You can remove all of the \optados\ output files by using \verb#./tools/optados_clean# in your working directory.  If you have a parallel version of \optados\ compiled, now might be the time to try it out, if not, the serial version will be fine, but just take a bit longer.  You can set \verb#IPRINT : 2# to see a progress report in  \verb#Si2.odo#.  In parallel:

\verb#$ mpirun -np <nprocs> optados.SYSTEM.BUILD.COMMS_ARCH.x86_64 Si2# 

but your MPI implementation may be different.

\item In  \verb#Si2.odo# we now have a new section analysing the band gap in various ways.

\end{verbatim}

\optados\ is very careful in its band gap analysis. It uses the bare eigenvalues (un-broadened) and works out the nature and size of the thermal gap, optical gap and the average gap over all of the Brillouin zone. In cases of multi-valleyed semiconductors \optados\ will report the number of conduction band minima or valence band maxima with identical energies, but will not report the nature of the gap. 

Increasing the number of integration points has improved the band energy of the adaptive smearing:
\begin{verbatim}
|          Band energy (Adaptive broadening) :       1.3623 eV         <- BEA |
\end{verbatim}


%%%%  Step 6 %%%%%
\item  Now set {\tt TASK : compare\_dos} and re-run \optados. \optados\ will calculate DOS using all the broadening methods, this is good practice to see whether the broadening widths are appropriate before more advanced tasks are carried out, such as Joint-DOS, core and optical calculations.

Plotting the linear broadened DOS over the adaptive we see that the default adaptive broadening is appropriate,

\verb#xmgrace Si2.adaptive.agr -nxy Si2.linear.dat#

Linear broadening, although a massive improvement over fixed broadening, sometimes appears noisy if used with very low numbers of k-points. Linear and adaptive DOS should be compared and \verb#ADAPTIVE_SMEARING# may be tuned by eye until the adaptive DOS contains the features of the linear DOS, but with less noise.  Adding a random shift to a k-point mesh can greatly increase the quality of the DOS, especially if the k-point set contained the $\Gamma$-point. It generally pays off in computational time to have a coarse mesh at low symmetry points, than a fine mesh centred on high symmetry points. 

Both fixed and adaptive broadening can fail to plot the sharpest features, such as semi-core states, if the bin widths are too broad. These sharp features may be forced to be present using the narrowest Gaussian still reproducible by the chosen bin widths by setting \verb#FINITE_BIN_CORRECTION : true#.  

Linear broadening may also be improved by using \verb#HYBRID_LINEAR : true#. Van Hove singularities and other sharp features are now described at the adaptive broadening level if the bands are flatter than \verb#HYBRID_LINEAR_GRAD_TOL#. Hybrid linear may also take advantage of the finite bin correction if required.

\item Compare the fixed and adaptive DOS and see the advantage of adaptive broadening over standard Gaussian smearing.

\end{enumerate}


\section{Projected Density of States}
We assume the reader is familiar with the previous section on Density of States calculations and is now familiar with choosing broadening widths, and running \optados. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Outline} : This is a simple example of using \optados\ for calculating electronic density of states of 2 atoms of crystalline silicon projected onto LCAO basis states.
\item \emph{Input Files}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb#examples/Si2_PDOS/Si2_dos.cell# - The \castep\ cell file containing information about the simulation cell.
\item \verb#examples/Si2_PDOS/Si2_dos.param# - The \castep\ param file containing information about the parameters for the SCF and spectral calculations.
\item \verb#examples/Si2_PDOS/Si2_dos.odi# - The \optados\ input file, containing the parameters necessary to run \optados.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Choose a broadening scheme for the projected-DOS calculation and test using {\tt TASK : compare\_dos} as explained in the previous example. Checking that the  {\tt DOS\_SPACING} is sufficiently fine for the band energies to match.

\item Once the DOS looks suitable, switch to  {\tt TASK : pdos}. We choose to decompose the DOS into angular momentum channels ({\tt PDOS : angular}) and as in the previous example we choose to recalculate the Fermi level using the calculated DOS, rather than use the Fermi level suggested by \castep. 

\item Execute \optados.

\item  The output can be found in {\tt Si2.pdos.dat}.

The header shows that there are four projectors described below. The first containing the s-channels of both silicon atoms, the second the p-channels \emph{etc.}

\item The output is easily plotted using xmgrace:

\verb#xmgrace -nxy Si2.pdos.dat#

\item Setting {\tt DOS\_SPACING : 0.001} gives a high quality plot, as shown in Fig\,\ref{fig:Si2_PDOS}

\item[{\bf --}]  \verb#PDOS : Si1(p)# -- Output the p-channel on Si atom 1. (Resulting in one projector)
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Projected Bandstructure}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Outline} : This is a simple example of using \optados\ to calculate the electronic bandstructure of 2 atoms of crystalline silicon projected onto LCAO basis states. The process is almost identical to the PDOS example above, but requires performs the projections on a continuous k-point path rather than a grid.

\item \emph{Input Files}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb#examples/Si2_PDIS/Si2_pdis.cell# - The \castep\ cell file containing information about the simulation cell.
\item \verb#examples/Si2_PDIS/Si2_pdis.param# - The \castep\ param file containing information about the parameters for the SCF and spectral calculations.
\item \verb#examples/Si2_PDOS/Si2_pdis.odi# - The \optados\ input file, containing the parameters necessary to run \optados.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Run \castep\ in the same way as previous examples, ensuring that \verb#PDOS_CALCULATE_WEIGHTS: TRUE# is set in the CASTEP parameter file.
\item Run \optados\ with the desired projections, following the same format as \verb#PDOS# in \verb#Si2_pdis.odi#.
\item The output can be found in \verb#Si2_pdis.dat#, which contains the weight of each projector at each eigenvalue, for each k-point. Plotting this data in an attractive way is tricky; you might consider trying the Python package \verb#matador# (www.matador.science).
\end{enumerate}

\section{JDOS}
See  \verb#examples/Si2_JDOS/#. This is a simple example of using \optados\ for calculating joint electronic density of states.  We choose to recalculate the Fermi level using the calculated DOS, rather than use the Fermi level suggested by \castep\, and so \verb#EFERMI: OPTADOS# is included in the \verb#Si2.odi# file.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Execute \optados\ using the example files.  The JDOS is outputted to {\tt Si2.jadaptive.dat}. A file suitable for plotting using {\tt xmgrace} is written to {\tt Si2.jadaptive.agr}.
\item Check the effect of changing the sampling by increasing and decreasing the value of \verb#JDOS_SPACING# in the \verb#Si2.odi# file. 
\item If {\tt TASK : compare\_jdos} is used instead, \optados\ will calculate the JDOS using all the broadening methods.  This is good practice to see whether the broadening widths are appropriate before more advanced tasks are carried out.  
\end{enumerate}

\section{OPTICS}
Two sets of example files are provided for calculations of optical properties.  For each example, the \castep\ files containing all the cell and simulation parameters are included, along with an \optados\ input file. We assume that the reader is familiar with the previous sections on DOS and JDOS.  
\begin{itemize}
\item[{\bf --}]  \verb#examples/Si2_OPTICS/#  This is a simple example of using \optados\ to calculate the optical properties of crystalline silicon, which is an insulator.   
\item[{\bf --}]\verb#examples/Al_OPTICS/#  This is a simple example of using \optados\ to calculate the optical properties of a metal, aluminium. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Silicon}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose a broadening scheme for the JDOS as explained in the JDOS example.  Once the JDOS looks suitable, switch the \verb#task# from \verb#JDOS# to \verb#OPTICS# and execute \optados\ to calculate the optical properties.  Several \verb#*.dat# files are produced:
\begin{itemize}
\item[{\bf --}] \verb#Si2_OPTICS_absorption.dat# : This file contains the absorption coefficient (second column) as function of energy (first column).
\item[{\bf --}] \verb#Si2_OPTICS_conductivity.dat# : This file contains the conductivity outputted in SI units (Siemens per metre).  The columns are the energy, real part  and imaginary part of the conductivity respectively.  
\item[{\bf --}] \verb#Si2_OPTICS_epsilon.dat# : This file contains the dielectric function.  The columns are the energy and real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function respectively. The file header also includes the result of the sum rule $\int_o^{\omega'}Im\epsilon{}(\omega{})d\omega = N_{eff}(\omega')$.  $N_{eff}$ is the effective number of electrons contributing to the absorption process, and is a function of energy.    
\item[{\bf --}] \verb#Si2_OPTICS_loss_fn.dat# : This file contains the loss function (second column) as a function of energy (first column).  The header of the file shows the results of the two sum rules associated with the loss function $\int_o^{\omega'}Im\Big(\frac{-1}{\epsilon{}(\omega{})}\Big)\,\omega{}\,d\omega = N_{eff}(\omega')$ and $\int_o^{\omega'}Im\Big(\frac{-1}{\epsilon{}(\omega{})}\Big)\,\frac{1}{\omega}\,d\omega = \frac{\pi}{2}$.
\item[{\bf --}] \verb#Si2_OPTICS_reflection.dat# : This file contains the reflection coefficient (second column) as a function of energy (first column).
\item[{\bf --}] \verb#Si2_OPTICS_refractive_index.dat# : This file contains the refractive index.  The columns are the energy and real and imaginary parts of the refractive index respectively.  
\end{itemize}
Corresponding \verb#*.agr# files are also generated which can be plotted easily using xmgrace.

\item Change parameters \verb#JDOS_SPACING# and \verb#JDOS_MAX# and check the effect on the optical properties.  Note: all of the other optical properties are derived from the dielectric function.  

\item  The \optados\ input file has been set up to calculate the optical properties in the polycrystalline geometry (\verb#optics_geom = polycrystalline#).  It is possible to calculate either polarised or unpolarised geometries, or to calculate the full dielectric tensor.  To calculate the full dielectric tensor set \verb#optics_geom = tensor#.  This time only the file \verb#Si2_OPTICS_epsilon.dat# is generated.  The format of this file is the same as before (the columns are the energy and the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function respectively), but this time the six different components of the tensor are listed sequentially in the order $\epsilon_{xx}$, $\epsilon_{yy}$, $\epsilon_{zz}$, $\epsilon_{xy}$, $\epsilon_{xz}$ and $\epsilon_{yz}$.

\item Additional broadening can be included in the calculation of the loss function.  This is done by including the keyword \verb#optics_lossfn_broadening# in the \optados\ input file.  If you include this keyword and re-run \optados, you will find that the file \verb#Si2_OPTICS_loss_fn.dat# now has three columns.  These are the energy, unbroadened spectrum and broadened spectrum respectively.  

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Aluminium}
\begin{enumerate}
\item As for the silicon example, a broadening scheme for the JDOS should first be determined.  
\item Aluminium is a metal so we need to include both the interband and intraband contributions to the dielectric function.  To include the intraband contribution \verb#optics_intraband# \verb#= true# must be included in the \optados\ input file.  When you run \optados\, the same files are generated as when only the interband term is included.  

The \verb#Al_OPTICS_epsilon.dat# file has the same format as before, but it now contains sequentially the interband contribution, the intraband contribution and the total dielectric function.  (The file \verb#Al_OPTICS_epsilon.agr# only contains the interband term.)  In the same way, \verb#Al_OPTICS_loss_fn.dat# contains the interband contribution, intraband contribution and total loss function.  All other optical properties are calculated from the total dielectric function and the format of the output files remains the same.

\item In the case where the dielectric tensor is calculated and the intraband term is included, only the \verb#Al_OPTICS_epsilon.dat#  file is generated.  As before it contains each component, but this time it lists sequentially the interband contribution, intraband contribution and total dielectric function for each component.   

\item This time, if additional broadening for the loss function is included by using the key word \verb#optics_lossfn_broadening#, \verb#AL_OPTICS_loss_fn.dat# will contains four sequential data sets.  These are the interband contribution, the intraband contribution, the total loss function without the additional broadening and the broadened total loss function.  
\end{enumerate}

\section{CORE}
See  \verb#examples/Si2_CORE/#. This is a simple example of using \optados\ for calculating core level absorption spectra for crystalline silicon.  We assume that the reader is familiar with the previous section on calculating DOS.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item We begin by running a \castep\ calculation using the files provided in \verb#examples/Si2_CORE#.  Note that we do not specify pseudopotentials in the \verb#Si2_CORE.cell# file hence require \castep\ to generate on-the-fly pseudopotentials.  This is important as most pseudopotential formats do not contain enough information for the PAW reconstruction needed for a CORE calculation. For any atom a CORE spectra is to be calculated an On-the-fly pseudopotential must be used.

Execute \optados\ using the \optados\ input file provided and the file \verb#Si2_CORE_core_edge.dat# will be created.  The file contains two columns, the first is the energy and the second is the spectrum.  This file contains the following edges:

\begin{verbatim}
 # Si 1    K1
 # Si 1    L1
 # Si 1  L2,3
 # Si 2    K1
 # Si 2    L1
 # Si 2  L2,3
\end{verbatim}
$i.e.$ all edges from all atoms are produced.    

\item To include a core-hole in the calculation, first one atom is chosen to have the excitation.  To begin, we will keep two atoms in the unit cell and distinguish one atom by changing the \verb#%BLOCK POSITIONS_FRAC#
\begin{verbatim} 
     %BLOCK POSITIONS_FRAC
            Si:exi    0.0000000000    0.0000000000    0.0000000000
            Si        0.2500000000    0.2500000000    0.2500000000
      %ENDBLOCK POSITIONS_FRAC
\end{verbatim}
in the \verb#Si2_CORE.cell# file.  The atom \verb#Si:exi# is the one to have a core-hole.  To create a core-hole we remove a 1s electrons from the electronic configuration used in the generation of the pseudopotential.  We have already generated an on-the-fly pseudopotential without a core-hole in the previous section.  Information about the pseudopotentials is included at the top of the \verb#Si2_CORE.castep# file.

The line 
\begin{verbatim}
    2|1.8|1.8|1.3|2|3|4|30:31:32LGG(qc=4)
\end{verbatim}
specifies the parameters used to create the pseudopotential.  We use this as the starting point and then remove one of the core 1s electrons to create a core-hole pseudopotential.  This is done by including \verb#{1s1.00}# in the pseudopotential string as shown:
\begin{verbatim}
    2|1.8|1.8|1.3|2|3|4|30:31:32LGG{1s1.00}(qc=4)
\end{verbatim}
If, instead of removing a 1s electron, we wanted to remove a 2s electron from the core, we would have included \verb#{2s1.00}# instead of \verb#{1s1.00}# in the pseudopotential string.

We are only interested in the spectra from the atom with the core-hole and so copy the pseudopotential file generated by the previous calculation (\verb#Si_OFT.usp#) to \verb#Si_LDA.usp#.  Then include 
\begin{verbatim}
      %BLOCK SPECIES_POT
            Si:exi    2|1.8|1.8|1.3|2|3|4|30:31:32LGG{1s1.00}(qc=4)
            Si        Si_LDA.usp
      %ENDBLOCK SPECIES_POT
\end{verbatim}
in the \castep\ \verb#Si2_CORE.cell# file.  


To maintain the neutrality of the cell, we include 
\begin{verbatim}
  CHARGE : +1 
\end{verbatim}
in the \verb#Si2_CORE.param# file.  Run the calculation.  This time the \verb#Si2_CORE_core_edge.dat# file will contain only the edges from the core-hole atom.  Compare the K-edge from the core-hole calculation with the previous non-core-hole calculation.  

\item The periodic images of the core-hole will interact with one another.  As this is unphysical, we need to increase the distance between the core-holes.  This is done by creating a supercell.  To start with we use a face-centred unit cell rather than the primitive unit cell.  This is done by changing the lattice parameters and fractional co-ordinates to:

\chapter{ONETEP Examples}
\section{(L)PDOS}
\onetep\ outputs an \optados\ compatible \verb@seedname_prefix.bands@ file, and from version 4.2 onwards, a \verb@seedname_prefix.pdos_bin@, \verb@seedname_prefix.dome_bin@ and a \verb@seedname-out.cell@ file. Where \verb@prefix@ may be one of \verb@val@, \verb@cond@ or \verb@joint@. 
%
A normal \onetep\  run will only output the valence files (\verb@val@), if conduction states are required, a \onetep\  conduction calculation should be run, in which case the \verb@cond@ and \verb@joint@ files will also be written to disk. 
%
For a full DOS (conduction and valence), the \verb@joint@ files should be used with \optados.

When running \onetep\ , in order to output \optados\ compatible files, \verb@DO_PROPERTIES@ must be set in the input file or a properties calculation must be run in continuation of a prior, converged calculation.

\verb@PDOS_OPTADOS_OUTPUT@ should be set to \verb@TRUE@,  this is the default value.

\verb@PDOS_MAX_L=integer@, where \verb@integer@ specifies the maximum angular momentum spherical wave to project onto, i.e. s=0, p=1, d=2, etc.

\verb@DOS_SMEAR@ should be set to a value greater than 0.0.
%
When \verb@DOS_SMEAR>0.0@, then the \verb@seedname_prefix.bands@ file will be written to disk, if \verb@PDOS_MAX_L>=0@, then a PDOS calculation will be performed and the associated files (mentioned above) will also be written to disk.

When outputting the PDOS weights in \verb@seedname_prefix.pdos_bin@, \onetep\  will also output a text file called \verb@pdos_weights.dat@ which is not associated with \optados\, but meant for manual inspection of the PDOS weights.

\onetep\  does not produce an \optados\ input file, this should be the only additional file (besides an \optados\ binary) required to perform a \onetep\ +\optados\ (L)PDOS calculation.

All of the DOS functionality in \onetep\  is also PAW compatible, though it is not mandatory.


\section{EELS/ELNES}

\onetep\  can also produce \optados\ compatible \verb@seedname.elnes_bin@ files by asking for an EELS\cite{tait:JPCM:2016} (conduction calculation) properties post-processing calculation. This is done by specifying \verb@COND_CALC_EELS=TRUE@ in the \onetep\ input file.

To perform an EELS calculation, the PAW method must be used (\verb@PAW=TRUE@ specified in the input file and PAW datafiles for each species). For those species which the user wishes to probe core to conduction transitions, core wavefunction data must also be supplied.

Finally, for EELS calculations, a conduction calculation must be performed, so \verb@COND_ENERGY_RANGE@, which specifies the energy window above the HOMO in which conduction states will be optimised and \verb@COND_ENERGY_GAP@, which specifies the energy gap between the highest optimised state and the lowest un-optimised state must be set in the \onetep\ input file.

\chapter{Frequently Asked Questions}

\section{\optados\ crashes complaining that it can't read the
  seed.bands or seed.cst\_ome file.}
Which version of \castep\ are you using? See Sect.\,\ref{sect:lff}.

\section{The examples do not work and I'm using \castep\ version 6.0}
\castep\ version 6.0 was released during the transition of the spectral module and features. The easiest way to solve this is to obtain a  copy of \castep\ $>6.0$, where \optados\ will work ``out of the box''.  However, to make the examples work with \castep\ 6.0 the \optados\ examples require a few tweaks outlined below.
\begin{itemize}
\item Replace \verb#SPECTRAL_KPOINTS_MP_GRID# in the cell file with \verb#BS_KPOINTS_MP_GRID# and \verb#OPTICS_KPOINTS_MP_GRID#.
\item Remove \verb#SPECTRAL_TASK : DOS# from the param file.
\item Add \verb#DEVEL_FLAG:old_filename# to the odi file.
\item Add \verb# WRITE_CELL_STRUCTURE : true# to your \castep\ cell file to generate the symmetries of the cell if you are doing pdos, core or optics calculations.
\item Read Section\,\ref{pdos_castep_6.0} if you are planning to do a partial density of states calculation.
\end{itemize}

\section{I'm getting odd results for my PDOS calculation when using \castep\ version 6.0} \label{pdos_castep_6.0}
The spectral module in \castep\ 6.0 generates the pdos weights commensurate with the optics grid you have chosen. However this gets overwritten by the main routines. Hence to get the right PDOS weights you must set \verb#PDOS_CALCULATE_WEIGHTS : FALSE# in the param file.

\section{\optados\ is reporting the wrong number of kpoints}
This is a rare bug that can happen if you have picked the magic k-point offset for your grid, that is a $3/(4n)$ offset where $n$ is the number of MP grid points in that direction. It is a very difficult edge-case to catch. Until a permanent workaround is found you can tell \optados\ the right number using the \verb#KPOINT_MP_GRID nx ny nz# in the odi file. 

\section{I'd like \optados\ to do X as well}
Contact the developers we're always interested in discussing new functionality.

\section{I'd like to help, what can I do?}
Contact the developers, there's always more functionality that we'd
like to add to the code.  

\section{I think I've found a bug: what should I do?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Check and re-check that it is a bug.  
\item Check the output of the electronic structure code.
\item Check that you're using the latest version of \optados.
\item Email the developers the input and output files with
  \verb#iprint : 3# and as much information about the problem as possible.
\end{itemize}



\begin{appendix}

\chapter{Interface with other codes}
Currently \optados\ is interfaced with \castep\ and \textsc{onetep}.
%
This appendix consists of Fortran95 code which defines the input files for \optados\ so as to aid its interfacing with other electronic structure codes.
%
Presented below are the type declaration statements and write statements that may be used in other electronic structure codes or converters to generate the .bands, .ome\_bin, .pos\_bin and .elnes\_bin files used as inputs to \optados.
%
These code snippets are also available in the \texttt{tools/} directory of the \optados\ distribution.

\section{\texttt{.bands} file}
The \texttt{.bands} file is necessary for any calculation using \optados\ it contains the energy eigenvalues at each k-point and data about the electronic properties of the system.
%
The bands file is a formatted file.

\section{\texttt{.ome\_bin} file}
The \texttt{.ome\_bin} file is required for adaptive and linear broadening, and for optics calculations. 
%
Note that a \texttt{.dome} file is just the diagonal elements of the \texttt{.ome}.
%
The \texttt{.ome\_bin} file is an unformatted file.
%
Note that, in line with many other electronic structure codes, \optados\ reads in the momentum matrix elements, $\langle \psi^c_{\bf k}  |  {\bf p} | \psi^v_{\bf k} \rangle$, and converts them to OMEs internally.
