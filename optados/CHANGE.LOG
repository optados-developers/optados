OptaDOS Version 1.2.380 14th February 2015

* In optics: Off-diagonal tensor terms have been corrected and intraband epsilon_2 terms are outputted as epsilon_2 rather than epsilon2xenergy
* For core loss calculations:: spin is included properly, broadening has been updated but spikes have not been completely eliminated
* Added a KPOINT_MP_GRID keyword. So that a user can tell OptaDOS the right grid, in the case that it got it wrong. Put this into the FAQ explaining when this rare even happens.
* Forced OptaDOS to exit if it cannot find symmetries in the seedname-out.cell. They should always be there, even if it's just the identiy. When doing lagacy file format, forced the user to provide a seedname-out.cell file.
* Corrected a bug that misrreported a kpoint grid as 3x MP not 5x MP when CASTTEP 6 and 7 generated a hexagonal cell. OptaDOS worked ok using CASTEP 8. Thanks to Nicholas McDougall.

OptaDOS Version 1.0.370 9th January 2013
	
* Minor Buxfix to Makefile. Thanks to Michael Rutter.
* Added tools/ direcotry containing code snippets for interfacing to other codes to generate the bands, ome_bin, pdos_bin and elnes_bin files. 
* Updates to User Guide -- containing code snippets for interfacing to other codes to generate the bands, ome_bin, pdos_bin and elnes_bin files. 

OptaDOS Version 1.0.361 12th Novemeber 2013
	
* Fix a serious bug in which symmetry was not treated correctly for polarised core-loss
* Fix to elnes labelling

OptaDOS Version 1.0.357 30th October 2013

* Fixed bug: Where dos_utils was still looking for 'castep' as a valid keyword for efermi. When it should have been looking for 'file'.
* Minor code tweaks for compatibility with the CASTEP version

OptaDOS Version 1.0.346

optados-1.0.346.tar.gz [NEW -- 10 Sept 2013]
Moved and updated README install.
Now /all/ MPI threads do linear smearing with Gaussian.
Fix bug in user_guide describing projection onto AM channels. It had square brackets not parentheses.
added functionality to smear the linear dos.
Made compute_band_gap = .true. the default.
Added a Free Electron Gas for testing purposes.
Added a dashed vertical line for e_fermi in plots
Added a copyright variable. One place for updating "(c) 2010-20now".
OptaDOS now responds to "optados -h" or "optados --help". It will also give a help message if no seedname is specified.
Changed the ticklables in the agr file to Helvetica. This was commented out so printed them in Times.

OptaDOS Version 1.0.296

optados-1.0.296.tar.gz
Bug fix of uninitialised variable in pdos.F90 causing a one-letter atomic species to have the second letter of a previously found two-letter atomic species
Added another tweak to the src/makefile and removed a bug from the user_gudie -- patch submitted by K. Refson
Modifications for compatibility with CASTEP's make system
Fix for legacy format

OptaDOS Version 1.0.290

optados-1.0.290.tar.gz
fix lorentz broadening and write out broadened agr
test logicals correctly
echo core optics keywords
Modified parameters.f90 so that it writes out all of the keywords. N.B. dos_nbins, dos_max_energy etc will only be written out if iprint>1.
fix overlong lines
Added new spectral file formats
label core hole edges correctly
parameters.f90 - change default adaptive smearing parameter from 1.4 to 0.4
add Examples
The cell_find_MP_grid was a bit too accurate, and I've had to open up some of it's tolerances. It now sucessfully finds the 24x24x24 grid
optics.f90 - small changes to constants
Changed the fields and colours in write_optics_xmgrace
Removed seg fault bug
Now writes out 4 column data
Added iprint 0 for really minimal poutput
Beautified the output for when compute band gap is true
Changes to output format iprint 1 good, iprint 2 is fine, iprint 3 is acceptable
Modified output of DOS and PDOS to new style
add keywords for loss function broadening
optics.f90 - loss fn broadening added
jdos_utils.f90 - exclude bands added
Changed floor to ceiling in efermi insulator routines (BUG)
add exclude_bands keyword
Changed efermi_choice to efermi
make band_gradient a real quantity and add optical_mat
Removed dos_zero_tol from code, since it is no longer required
Several things inc consistent treatment of Fermi level
Added core_type
Added symmetry for reduced BZ and polar geom
Finite bin correction default set to true.
Fixed a typo in writing out the .dat file in both dos.f90 and jdos.f90
dos_utils.f90 -- Removed the decision to force compute_band_gap, since all_kpoints would have already been deallocated, causing a set fault in later routines.
Now got the bandgap solver right.
First attempt at getting compute_band_gap to report the actualy kpoint's fractional positions
